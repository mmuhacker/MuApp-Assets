    <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p>These Terms and Conditions apply to the <strong>Muhannad's News</strong> app (hereinafter referred to as the "Application") for mobile devices that was created by <strong>Muhannad Daher</strong> (hereinafter referred to as the "Service Provider") as an ad-supported service.</p>

    <p>Upon downloading or using the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms. You are strongly advised to read and understand these terms carefully before using the Application.</p>

    <p>Copying or modifying the Application, any part of it, or our trademarks without permission is strictly prohibited. Attempting to extract the source code of the Application, translating it into other languages, or creating derivative versions is also prohibited. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application belong to the Service Provider.</p>

    <p>The Service Provider is committed to ensuring that the Application is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, they reserve the right to make changes to the Application or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that you will be clearly notified of any charges related to the Application or its services.</p>

    <p>The Application stores and processes certain usage data and user-generated content (such as AI chats and generated images) locally on the user's device to provide the service. It is your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the Application secure.</p>

    <p>The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware, viruses, and malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features, and it may mean that the Application will not work properly or at all.</p>

    <p>Please be aware that the Application uses third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>

    </ul>

    <p>Please be aware that there are certain things that the Service Provider will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the Application will require the Application to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot take responsibility for the Application not working at full functionality if you do not have access to Wi-Fi, or if you have run out of your data allowance.</p>

    <p>If you are using the Application outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the Application, or other third-party charges. In using the Application, you are accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the Application outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the Application, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the Application.</p>

    <p>Along the same lines, the Service Provider cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the Application. For example, you need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can't turn it on to avail the Service, the Service Provider cannot accept responsibility.</p>

    <p>With respect to the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the Application, when you are using the Application, it is important to bear in mind that although they endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, they do rely on third parties to provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the Application.</p>

    <p>The Application uses Artificial Intelligence technologies to provide certain features and services.

The Service Provider ensures that all AI usage complies with applicable laws and is designed to improve user experience.</p>

    <p>The Service Provider may wish to update the Application at some point. The Application is currently available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems solely decided by the Service Provider to extend the availability of the Application to), which may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to keep using the Application. The Service Provider does not promise that they will always update the Application so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the operating system version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, The Service Provider may also wish to stop providing the Application, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless the Service Provider tells you otherwise, upon any termination, <br>
    (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; <br>
    (b) you must stop using the Application, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
